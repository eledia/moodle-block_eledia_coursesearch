# Admin Settings
The admin settings are unfinished due to time constraints. Usually you don't have to touch them after installation.  
Changing the settings might result in unpredictable behaviour (vanishing search fields, error messages, but nothing dangerous).  
Most of the settings are carried over from block couresoverview and often have no funcion anymore. Others should not be changed.  
If you want to contribute to the project and fix this, you are welcome :-)
