# How to make the plugin available to users
## Boost Union theme
Because the plugin is a *block*, it only is recommended to display it on the dashboard.  
To display the plugin to all users on the dashboard, 
- go to *Site Administration* **&arr;** *Appearance* **&arr;** *Default Dashboard page*  
- Turn edit mode on
- Click *Add a block*
- Add the plugin
- Turn edit mode off
- Click on *Reset Dashboard for all users*
Now the course search is available to all users.
